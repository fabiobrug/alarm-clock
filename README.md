## 📌 About the Project

This project was created for **educational and practical purposes**, focused on improving skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It simulates a **fully functional alarm clock** that runs directly in the browser.

Users can **set a custom time** and activate the alarm by clicking the "Alarm" button. When the countdown reaches zero, the alarm is triggered visually and audibly.
